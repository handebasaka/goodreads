## My Reading Journey: Insights from Goodreads Data

I joined Goodreads in 2019 to keep track of my reading adventures and even added a few books I’d read in previous years. Fast forward to today, my reading pace has picked up, and curiosity got the best of me—I started wondering about my reading habits and whether they reveal any interesting patterns or trends.

To satisfy my inner data geek, I exported my Goodreads data and, for an extra layer of analysis, manually added the authors’ genders where they weren’t already listed.

So, here it is—the story of my bookshelf, told through data! Let’s dive into the insights waiting to be uncovered.

To get started on analysing my reading data in Python, we will need some packages below:
- `pandas`: It is a data analysis and manipulation library that provides data structures and tools.
- `numpy`: It is a numerical computing library that provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and mathematical functions.
- `matplotlib.pyplot`: It is a plotting library for creating visualizations in Python.
- `seaborn`: It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.


## Goals
- The goal of this project is to understand my reading trends by analyzing Goodreads data.

## Tools and Technologies Used
`Python`

`Pandas` and `Numpy` for data manipulation 

`Matplotlib` and `Seaborn` for data visualization
